# PasswordGenerator

## Description:
This is a webpage that creates a password for you based on specific criteria. After clicking the generate button, the user will recieve a few notifactions to either confirm or disallow the use of specific character types in their desired password. Based on the user choices, the program will use different functions and conditionals to randomly generate a password that satisfies a desired length and use of character types. Each time the button is clicked, the program resets and generrates a new password. This program uses a combination of basic JavaScript conditionals and methods to accomplish it's task. This includes 'if' statements as well as 'while' loops and a few random generation methods.

## Usage:
After landing on the page, the user should press the red generate password button. This will prompt the user to choose a desired length, followed by some conditional choices that will set the character type list to be used in generation. Once the choices have been confirmed, the program will generate a new password and output it to the "New Password" box in the center of the screen.
